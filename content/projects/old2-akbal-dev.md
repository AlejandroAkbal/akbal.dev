The second version of my website.

It was my first attempt at building a website with the `Bootstrap` CSS framework, and I had tons of fun with it.

Since I didn't know the inner workings of Bootstrap, I had a bad time customizing it, but I didn't care about that very much since I was prototyping very fast.

Aside from frontend, I learned a thing or two about tooling. I used `Gulp` to minify, process and transpile the HTML, CSS, and JS so all the browsers would be supported.

I initially hosted it on GitHub pages, to get to know how it worked, and it was a success. Free static hosting is always welcome.

I then moved on to Netlify, as it was a superior service, at the same price.
