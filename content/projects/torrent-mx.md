Commercial project for a Torrent-based website where I was tasked to design and build the Front end.

I learned a lot about freelancing, specifically the client aspect.
For example: how to communicate correctly, set a goal, set milestones and send invoices.

I delivered a responsive static website with 5 pages. It was then refactored to React and integrated into the client's code base.
