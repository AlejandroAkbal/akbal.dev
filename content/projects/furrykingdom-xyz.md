Commercial project for a community based website where I was tasked to design and build the Front end.

This was supposed to replace their [original website](https://furrykingdom.xyz).

I initially used Gridsome, and then migrated to Nuxt as I needed some advanced features.

Hosted on Netlify, so the client could check the changes and provide insight.

I delivered a responsive static web application with 2 pages.
