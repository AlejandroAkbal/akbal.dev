Personal project.

The goal was to make a web application that would get the content from many APIs and display them in a responsive and beautiful interface.

And that is what I did.

I had to learn many things while building it; Vue.JS, Nuxt, how PWAs worked, localStorage, JSON APIs, Authentication, Authorization, etc.

But in the end, it was worth it.
I built a project that I'm proud of, even if it is a NSFW web application.

Moreover, I have a beautiful community behind that supports me to keep developing it.
