Personal project for a person that is dear to me.

I delivered a responsive web portfolio to showcase the illustrations of an artist.

Since it is a website that a non-technical person would have to manage, I decided to go for a WordPress website, which has a CMS for managing its content.

Later on a small eCommerce store was integrated to sell its various prints.

The website was hosted on a VPS from DigitalOcean, managed automatically by Cloudron.

This proved useful as I did not have to get involved for small changes.
Plus the client has greater ownership of their website.
