Personal project.

I created this web application to help e-book authors maintain the links in their books healthy.

It achieves this goal by continuously checking the status of the links and redirecting them to a backup if they are broken.

The idea came to me when I was searching for a solution to broken links in articles.
I swiftly found a competitor, but I was unhappy with their solution. 
Ultimately, I decided to create my own, while learning Laravel on the process.

**That was a key step in my journey**. Working with Laravel made all the other projects I've worked on, feel inferior. This is how good it is.

The beautiful art displayed in this project is the work of [Ana Tejedor DÃ­ez](https://anatejedordiez.com/).

Finally, its worth mentioning that this is my very first [open startup](https://openstartup.tm/) project.
This means that all the revenue and metrics are shared in the [open page](https://constant.link/open).
