My very first website.

I decided to create it just for fun, to explore what the web could do.

I learned a lot from this project alone:

I had to build and secure a Google Cloud Engine instance, which was running on Debian 9. This task was very daunting at first, but I really enjoyed playing with all the bits and bobs of GNU/Linux.

I also learned PHP and Databases. I used them to store the score for a [mini-game](https://old.akbal.dev/webpages/clicker.php) and colors for a [theme repository](https://old.akbal.dev/webpages/temas.php).
