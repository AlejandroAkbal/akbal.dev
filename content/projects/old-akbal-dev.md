My very first website.

I decided to create it just for fun, to explore what the web could do.

From this project alone I learned a lot:

I had to build and secure a Google Cloud Engine Debian 9 instance. Which was very daunting at first, but I really enjoyed it.

I also learned PHP and Databases. I used them to store the score for a [mini-game](https://old.akbal.dev/webpages/clicker.php) and theme colors for a [theme repository](https://old.akbal.dev/webpages/temas.php).

PS:
Try clicking the `Akbal's` header on the landing page. ;')
